Last weekend we had a lovely few days in Mousehole in Cornwall. It's a small harbour just along the coast from Penzance and it very cute in that typically Cornish harbour way. I'm not sure why I haven't been before since I've been to pretty much everywhere in Cornwall before. Having said that we also popped in to Land's End, another place I haven't been before (and less tacky than I thought it might be, mainly because you can ignore the tacky bits). Anyway, Mousehole was great. If you ever find yourself there then I really recommend The Old Coastguard - it's a very good bar/restaurant with great views. The Ship Inn is also a good pub with great pub food. I was surprised that there weren't more places to eat/drink on the seafront actually - the old Lobster Pot restaurant is now flats, and with so many tourists clogging the place up you'd have thought that there was money to be made. Ho hum.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm starting a small phase of visiting places beginning with 'C' and I'm now in China. I'm in a rather nice hotel in Shenzhen having arrived via Hong Kong a few hours ago. The flight was as ok as flights can be - the extra legroom I had this time (last time I flew to Hong Kong in Economy my legs didn't really fit) made it much more comfortable. Funnily enough I sat next to a guy from Cornwall on the plane and we talked about last weekend. There's some massive trade conference going on here and he's over to sell his wares. The hotel staff were slightly surprised when I said that I wasn't here for the conference and perhaps it is bad timing since a lot of flights were booked-up and I have to move hotels on Tuesday as this one is full. Not too bad for a trip mostly booked on Friday though.<br /><br />More on China as I experience it. In the meantime I have to adjust to the whole jetleg thing and chill out a bit...
