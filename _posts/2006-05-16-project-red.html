Bono is guest editor of The Independent today, and half of today's revenue <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4984864.stm">will go to fight AIDS</a>. Why not help fights AIDS while getting your news fix today and buy a copy of arguably the best national paper?<br /><br />Last night we went to see Luke (and some other people, obviously) in <a href="http://www.bristol-old-vic.co.uk/whatson/studio.php?show=222">My Head Was A Sledgehammer</a> at the Bristol Old Vic. Very avant-garde and abstract but great fun. You can catch it again tonight.<br /><br />After the glory of coming first in the 'Best Cake Baked By A Man' category in Matt's 'Birthday Spring Fete And Agricultural Show' last year, this years cake could only make second place over the weekend. Still, a good time was had by all and we had some happy hours sampling the various categories and voting. I will have to make cakes more often and get some practice in to ensure future first places.
