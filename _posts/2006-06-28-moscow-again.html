Here I am in Moscow again! Going by my blog I guess it doesn't look like I ever left, but I did the day after my last entry. I've done some stuff back in the UK of course but have mostly been busy with my OU course. I did attend the <a href="http://beehive.thisisbath.com/default.asp?WCI=SiteHome&ID=10776">Bath Storytelling Circle</a> in The Raven, which was rather good. We also went to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041386/">The Fountainhead</a> in the <a href="http://www.picturehouses.co.uk/cinema_home_date.aspx?venueId=bath">Little Theatre</a>, which was a one-off showing done by the Bath Film Festival. Very weird but good. The World Cup has been going on of course, and I've seen one game. It's about as interesting as football gets, I suppose.<br /><br />So anyway, here I am in Moscow again, and for slightly longer this time. It's hot and sunny which bodes well. There's some inconvenience with the hotel being quite full so I have to move rooms three times while I'm here, but that's last minute travel for you! At least I don't have to change hotels completely like I had to in China. I also get a weekend here too this time, so assuming work doesn't go all pear-shaped I might even get to see the parts of Moscow that aren't on the road to the airport or the office!
