It's flipping hot isn't it? Can't complain about the sunshine, but the heat does knacker me out a bit. My 2 mile or so walk home is all up a reasonably steep hill, and in this heat I'm pretty much soaked in sweat when I get home. Yum.. there's a mental image you could do without eh? Needless to say, I just want to chill out a bit with a gin and tonic when I get here so I'm not getting as much done as I'd like.<br /><br />Anyway, the weekend was good. On Sunday we went on what is now almost a traditional yearly trip to Longleat. I took a camera this time and managed to get some photos of animals (which you'll find on <a href="www.flickr.com/photos/dominic_tristram/">on my Flickr page</a>) before the battery inconveniently ran out. It was a lovely day but the downside of that was that pretty much everyone else seemed to have decided to go to Longleat on the same day, so it was very busy.<br /><br />Rather excitingly the company I work for got bought by another much bigger company yesterday. This has caused much idle gossip and speculation at work, which is always fun in itself. Time will tell how it all pans out I suppose - it doesn't make much of an immediate difference to me but our directors and senior management can probably retire early. Not that they will, the mugs. If I had enough money to retire then I would! Unfortunately my shares in the company aren't exactly going to go far towards paying off a months credit card bill, let alone the mortgage!
