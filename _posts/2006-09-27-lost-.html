So, series 2 of 'Lost' ended last night and I got that strange feeling of being satisfied, yet at the same time quite annoyed that it was all left in the air! I only watch about 3 things on TV at the moment, Lost being one of them, so in some ways it's good that the series is over as it frees-up another hour a week. At the same time though, I do like it. It's wacky and daft, but fairly compulsive none the less. Just right for telly really.
