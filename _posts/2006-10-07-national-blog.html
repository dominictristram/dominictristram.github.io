It has been all over the news this morning but in case you haven't seen it, you're encouraged to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6048392.stm">blog today for a national archive</a>. You don't have to be doing anything special as they simply want a snapshot of what life in Britain is like. It seems like an interesting and socially useful thing to take part in, so why not give it a go?
