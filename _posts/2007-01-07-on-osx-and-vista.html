In my 'tech predictions for 2007' I remarked on how Vista is a poor copy of OSX. This irked several people and I received the expected accusations of being a fanboy. Well, it's not just me - <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=196800670">this bias-free article from InformationWeek</a>compares OSX with Vista. Have a look. Most IT professionals won't argue that OSX isn't technically superior, and it's nice to have an article to point people to.
