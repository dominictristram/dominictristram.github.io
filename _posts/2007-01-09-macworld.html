Just a quick post - I'm away with work and grabbing two minutes. So, Macworld happened. The <a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/">AppleTV</a> (aka iTV) is pretty sweet, but <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">check out the iPhone!</a> It's super sexy. Sign me up for one... just as soon as they reach the UK. Looks like that might be at the 'end of the year' though.. bah!<br /><br />Good old Apple. When they do something they do it <em>right</em>.
