Technological progress has been slowed today by Ofcom after they ruled that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6290745.stm">the BBCs plans to provide content on demand are too good</a> and might hurt commercial competitors. Don't Ofcom realise that this ruling is completely stupid? The 'commercial competitors' won't be showing BBC programmes anyway, and the BBC service will <em>only</em> show BBC programmes. Where is the cross-over? As for 'damage to DVD sales', they are DVD sales that the BBC will lose! The whole thing is utterly stupid, and thanks to some stupid old men with weird ideas, having all of the BBC content I have already paid for (through my licence fee) available on demand looks like being that bit further away.
