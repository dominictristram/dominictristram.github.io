Windows Vista is unlikely to destroy the world all by itself of course, but <a href="http://www.greenparty.org.uk/news/2851">as this interesting article points out</a>, it will certainly help fill landfill sites, increase global warming, and result in mountains of perfectly good hardware being thrown away. Something to think about. As well as all of that it also takes away your right to do what you want with your own computer. I think this is going to hit creative people first, but will there be a backlash when people realise they can't watch their BlueRay or HD-DVD films because Microsoft doesn't approve of their monitor? We'll see.
