Last night I was at a preview showing of <a href="http://workingtitlefilms.com/film.php?filmID=99">Hot Fuzz</a>, the new comedy from Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright. Yes, that's right, the guys behind the brilliant <a href="http://www.spaced-out.org.uk/about-spaced/whatisspaced.shtml">Spaced</a> and <a href="http://www.shaunofthedeadmovie.com/">Shaun of the Dead</a>. So, apart from the excitement of seeing a film a week or two before general release and getting a bag full of goodies, what can I say? Basically it's very good - starts off a bit slowly and you wonder where they are going with it, but it soon turns into the highly amusing nonsense that you expect. It's vaguely interesting from a local perspective for me as well since it's filmed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells%2C_Somerset">Wells</a>, just down the road. While I enjoyed the film, I did think that the cinema had the volume cranked-up a bit too much. Perhaps I'm getting old but some of the load bits hurt my ears... I thought age was meant to make you deaf!
