Last night we went to the <a href="http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/news/article/0,,4020998,00.html">first Crowded House gig for years</a>
at the Thekla in Bristol. It was really very good. They played some stuff of their new
album that is being released in June, but there were enough old favourites there to keep
everyone more than happy, and they played for 2.5 hours so it was a good long set. The
tickets sold out pretty quickly and the 15 quid original price went up to about 400 quid
on eBay, which was a bit mad.

Crowded House are one of those bands that are a bit like the Beautiful South - I know I
like them but I don't realise how many songs I know until I'm at a gig! I guess I've got
three Crowded House albums and I listen to them reasonably often, so that might explain
it. It was a pleasant surprise to find myself able to sing along to most of the tracks
though. The band themselves seemed to enjoy it although there were some rough edges, but
that isn't completely surprising seeing as it has been so long since they've played
together in public, and this is a new line-up. Anyway, top stuff - catch them on their
new tour if you can...
