So, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> is still growing to encompass almost the entire world. This can't be ignored when you're a dynamic and hip Internet music outfit like we are here at <a href="http://www.thefilter.com/">The Filter</a>, so today we released the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/add.php?api_key=9297566416356880d1d36bdc08a0ecdc">MyFilter Facebook app</a>.<br /><br />Please give it a go. While you're at it, you can install the client (from our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Web site</a>) to get you personal charts and recommendations. You can get the client for Windows and OSX, of course. And Nokia phones.<br /><br />So, that might all sound like a bit of an advert, and I suppose it is. However, we've got some genuinely exciting plans and it's all free, so what have you got to lose? It's time for us all to rediscover our music collections!
