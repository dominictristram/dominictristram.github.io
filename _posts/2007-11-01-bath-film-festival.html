Today is the start of the <a href="http://www.bathfilmfestival.org.uk/">2007 Bath Film Festival</a>, and for the next eleven days there are some quality films. Some caught my eye.<br /><br /><a href="http://plus.maths.org/latestnews/sep-dec07/bbc/index.html">Beautiful Young Minds</a>, an interesting looking documentary about a maths competition (well, <em>I</em> think it sounds interesting!) on Saturday. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462504/">Rescue Dawn</a> is another film about Vietnam, but most importantly it has Christian Bale in it. Has he ever been in a bad film? I don't think so. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425321/">The Yacoubian Building</a> is a film about life in central Cairo that looks good and is being shown on Sunday. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401383/">The Diving Bell and the Butterfly</a> (Monday) is the story of a man who suffers a stroke - sad, but it looks quite inspiring. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410730/">Taxidermia</a> appeals to my surreal side (just look at plot outline!) and is on Monday. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0881934/">The Killing Of John Lennon</a> looks interesting, as do <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1032856/">The Band's Visit</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420509/">The Aura</a>. I'd also like to catch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071604/">Hearts and Minds</a>, an Oscar-winning documentary about the Vietnam war which is still pretty relevant. There's also an evening of locally made short films on the 11th which looks good.<br /><br />So, lots of films to see, or potentially see anyway. There are some others that I wanted to list but I don't want to just reel-off films as much as bring attention to the festival. It's all good!
