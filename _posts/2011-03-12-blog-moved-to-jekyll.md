title: Blog moved to Jekyll

p(meta). 12 March 2011

I have moved my blog to <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/">Jeykll</a>, a Ruby static site generator. I've been hosting a blog at home using Wordpress for a while, but I decided that running Wordpress (and a database behind it) was a bit heavy for what I needed. Static pages are fine, and Jekyll makes it all easy.

I will now start the rather labourious task of porting old blog entries over. Joy!
