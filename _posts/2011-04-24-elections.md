So it has been a while since I've posted anything, but as some of you may know, I have been busy with getting ready to stand for the local elections in May. I'm standing for the <a href="http://bath.greenparty.org.uk/localsites/bath/people/dominic-tristram.html">Green Party in Odd Down</a>, here in Bath. It has been a busy few weeks filling-in forms and sorting-out leaflets, but it's only a few weeks until the election now and there's little admin left to do, just leafleting, canvassing, and other actual 'politics'.

So I will be a bit quiet until the election is over as it's taking so much time. If you are a voter you can see our policies on our Web site <a href="http://bath.greenparty.org.uk/localsites/bath/">here</a>.

After looking at our policies, if you have any questions please either <a href="mailto:dominic@dominictristram.com">email me</a> or leave a question on this page.
