Today came the sad but largely unexpected news that Steve Jobs has died. The tributes from around the world have generally been spot-on - his impact on the world of computing was huge. The dedication to form and ease of use that confused so many in the industry were the reason for his success. The big manufacturers mocked Apple's efforts to make machines that not only performed well, but were well <em>designed</em>, but now we live in a world where most of them seem to simply copy what Apple do first.

So farewell, Steve. I'm sure you were as much of a bugger to work for as a lot of CEOs, but you've made my life better and put technology in the hands of many more 'normal' people.

I recommend reading <a href="bit.ly/cHpzGJ">this speech he have at Stanford in 2006.</a> It's quite inspirational.
