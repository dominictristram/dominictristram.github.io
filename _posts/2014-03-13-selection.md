I am pleased to say that I have been selected as the Green Party's Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for the Bath constituency for the 2015 General Election.

All elections are, of course, important. However, we have suffered from four years of one of the most regressive governments in living memory. Much damage has been done, especially to the NHS which is being dismantled by the Coalition's Health and Social Care Act. While the Conservative desire to sell-off the NHS surprises no-one, the fact that the Liberal Democrats have not only facilitated this but supported it has shocked many of their voters who now feel betrayed.

My current MP, Don Foster, is standing down. People are sick of what the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have done to the poor, the sick, and everyone who values social justice. Labour offer nothing except the same austerity. The time is right for the Green Party.
