I've been doing some maintenance of this site today and updated the look and feel. Please have
a look around and let me know if anything doesn't work on your device.

For fellow nerds: I'm still using static pages generated by [**Jekyll**](http://jekyllrb.com)
(which is excellent, by the way) - I have simply moved to a new theme and added some bits and
pieces of housekeeping that I've been meaning to do for some time.

I've forked the [**So Simple theme**](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme) by [**Michael Rose**](https://github.com/mmistakes), which seems to do everything I want and has a nice, clean look. It
also seems to render pretty well on the devices I have, but as I say, let me know if it doesn't
work well on your device.
