I wrote the following letter to the Bath Chronicle following the election of our first Green MEP in the South West, Molly Scott Cato:

Congratulations to Molly Scott Cato, Green Party MEP, and her team on
her election to the European Parliament. After coming close to gaining
an MEP in 2009, the Greens continue to grow as a party, both with
voter share and members, and as a result we will be sending our first
representative from the SW.

This election established the Green Party as the challengers to the
right wing policies of Tories, UKIP and Liberal Democrats. Voters who
support the Green Party at the General Election will be voting for the
genuinely radical party, committed to social justice and opposing
austerity. Locally within BaNES, Greens came third, beating Labour and
the Liberal Democrats. With the largest number of votes for a
progressive party, we are confident about the General Election next
year.

The Greens have campaigned on a positive manifesto of a Europe working
for the common good. We believe that this chimes with an increasing
number of voters who are interested in a parliament working to improve
the lives of everyone in the UK and Europe, rather than parties who
campaign on negativity and fail to vote for our interests in the
European Parliament.


Dominic Tristram,
Green Party Perspective Parliamentary Candidate for Bath
