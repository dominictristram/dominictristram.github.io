This evening I attended a <a href="http://democratic-accountability.org.uk/hustings/archive-hustings/carers-bnes-carers-centre/">
hustings at St Luke's church for the young carers</a> served by the
Carers' Centre.

It was a very interesting event with possibly the largest number of questions from the
audience for any hustings so far. Janine (chairing) did an excellent job of combining
similar questions etc, but there were still many left over which have been sent to the
candidates on the panel to answer.

Top marks to the Carers' Centre for a well organised event (and food, which is always
good!).
