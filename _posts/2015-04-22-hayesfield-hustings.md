Today I took part in a hustings held at Hayesfield School. It was a well organised
event, well chaired with candidates being held to their time limits - something I'm
all in favour of as it gets through more questions.

The school had allocated a sixth former to each candidate to introduce us, including
writing a short biography. This was a nice touch, and I'd like to thank my nominated
pupil Harriet Evans for her efforts, including injecting a bit of humour into it! It's
nice to remind people that politics doesn't have to be dry and dull.

I throughly enjoyed the hustings and I thought that the questions were really good. I
enjoyed staying behind afterwards and chatting to parents, teachers and students too.
There's a lot of support for the Greens and I was grateful to hear so many people tell
me as much.

You can view the event page on <a href="http://www.hayesfield.com/index.php/hayesfield-hustings-invitation-wednesday-22nd-april/">
the Hayesfield Web site</a> and see the associated page on the

Update 07/05/2015: The school held their own mock election and
<a href="http://www.hayesfield.com/index.php/events-at-hayesfield-to-mark-the-general-election/">the Greens won</a>! This means that every post-hustings poll of electors
throughout the whole campaign had the Greens in first or equal first place. Thank you!
