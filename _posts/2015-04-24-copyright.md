There have been some misconceptions about our policy on copyright in the last couple of
days, not helped by some inaccurate articles in the media. Let's set them straight.

Firstly, and most importantly, our manifesto simply states that we will review copyright
terms. The important point is that we oppose software patents - anyone who works in IT,
as I do, knows that is vital for the software industry.

Secondly, there is still confusion about what is actually in our manifesto. To be
clear, our manifesto is <a href="https://www.greenparty.org.uk/we-stand-for/2015-manifesto.html">available here</a>.
That is the manifesto - things you may have heard in the press that are in it, but that
aren't, simply aren't in it. The evidence is there for you to read.

Finally, Tom Chance has <a href="http://tomchance.org/2015/04/24/making-copyright-work-for-creatives/">written a
great article</a> on our views on copyright.
