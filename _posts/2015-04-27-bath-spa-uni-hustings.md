This hustings was organised by Bath Spa University and was held in the Komedia in Bath.

I was sat up on the stage with the other candidates, and the novelty here was a large
projected screen behind us showing live Tweets that were being sent by the audience.
It was slightly unnerving because we were obviously looking away from the screen -
you could be halfway through answering a question and the crowd would suddenly react
to a Tweet that had popped up.

The event went well. We had some of the questions in advance and there were some
unseen questions too.
