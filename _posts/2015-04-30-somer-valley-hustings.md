This was the last hustings of the campaign. It was held in Midsomer Norton Town Hall
and was broadcast live on Somer Valley FM. It was a North East Somerset event, and I
was standing in for our candidate Katy Boyce who was unavailable. Other panellists
were Ernie Blaber for UKIP, Todd Foreman for Labour, Wera Hobhouse for the Lib Dems
and Jacob Rees-Mogg for the Conservatives.

It was a lively but short debate to a packed venue. Tory supporters were out in force
in the audience - there were plenty of blue rosettes being worn - but the questions
were actually pretty even handed and the chairing was good. The organisers had taken
some trouble to invite questions from younger voters who had been specially invited,
so despite the Tory-heavy audience there was a good mix of questions being asked.

I was pleased with my answers and there were no surprises from any of the other
candidates. All in all it was a reasonably relaxed final event of the election and
afterwards I felt rather 'demob happy'!
