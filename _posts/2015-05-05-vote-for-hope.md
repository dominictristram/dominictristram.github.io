Voters of Bath, on Thursday you have an important choice to make.

You can choose one of four parties that:

 - believe in 'austerity', continuing punishing the poorest
 and most vulnerable in society for the mistakes of the richest
 - support the involvement of the private sector in our NHS, removing
 vital funds from the front line to put into the pockets of shareholders
 - don't believe that education should be free
 - insist that we should allow fracking, despite potential risks to our
 water supply and the continuing threat of catastrophic climate change.

You can choose one of
four parties that all believe the same thing, but to different degrees.

Or... you can choose the Green Party.

Only the Green Party <b>rejects austerity</b>. We believe that in the sixth richest country
in the world it shames us all that some people cannot afford to eat while others see
their immense wealth grow ever larger. We are the only party to demand that the poorest
are protected by asking the richest to pay a little more back to society. We will restore
the public sector and bring back vital services.

Only the Green Party will <b>give the NHS the Â£12bn extra it needs</b> every year, halt and
then push back privatisation, and ultimately scrap the failed 'internal market' 
ideological experiment that costs billions and helps no-one.

Only the Green Party believes that <b>education should be free</b>, and wealth no barrier to
ambition. Only we will scrap tuition fees and write-off government held student debt.

Only the Green Party will <b>ban fracking</b>. Other parties might claim to care about the
environment, but those are hollow words from any party that is willing to use ever
more fossil fuels. 

The system is clearly broken. There is only one real choice for change, and that choice is Green.

Finally, I want to address tactical voting. As a party we don't support it, since we
think that nothing will change if people don't vote for what they actually want.
The columnist George Monbiot has written an <a href="">excellent article</a> on this
in which he says "...do we keep voting for a diluted version of Tory politics, for
fear of the concentrate? Or do we start to vote for what we want? Had the people of
this nation heeded the noseholders a century ago, we would still be waiting for the
Liberal party to deliver universal healthcare and the welfare state."

However, the local Lib Dem campaign seems to have
exclusively consisted of telling people that it's 'either us or the Tories' and some
people might be tempted to believe them.
It simply
isn't true, so if you are considering voting
tactically to 'keep the Tories out', consider this:

 - No party is expected to get an outright majority
 - The Green Party beat the Lib Dems and Labour at the last election in Bath (the Euros)
 - The Liberal Democrats have already enabled five years of Tory government. They have
 said they'd do it again. Electing a Lib Dem MP is <em>the same</em> as electing a Tory
 MP, as far as enabling Tory government goes
 - UKIP have said many times that they will work with a Tory government
 - Labour have said they would rather see a Tory government than work with the SNP. The
 only way they could form a government is to work with the SNP
 
So you see, even using the tactical argument, a Green vote is the best 'anti Tory' vote
you can make.

All I ask is that you consider everyone standing and vote for the one that you agree
with most. That is the way democracy is meant to work, and this is the first election in
Bath for a long time where it can indeed work that way, whatever the other parties say.
You can read what we believe <a href="https://www.greenparty.org.uk/we-stand-for/2015-manifesto.html">
here, in our manifesto</a>.

On Thursday you can vote for someone you don't really agree with from fear of someone
worse - a vote that will ensure that nothing really changes.  Or you can vote for the
policies we need for a fair, just and caring society -
a vote for hope.

We can do this. We must do this. For the Common Good.
