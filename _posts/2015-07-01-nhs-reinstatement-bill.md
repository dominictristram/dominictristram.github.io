I wrote the following letter to the Bath Chronicle today:

<em>As I write this on the 1st of July, Green MP Caroline Lucas is presenting the NHS Reinstatement Bill
to Parliament. In a nutshell this cross-party bill seeks to reinstate the NHS based on its founding
principles and reverse the creeping privatisation and marketisation of our NHS. It would strip away
the costly and wasteful market mechanisms and return much-needed funds to treating patients, rather
than the massively bureaucratic process of splitting NHS services into tiny parts for handing-out to
private companies and NHS organisations - a process reckoned to cost billions per year.</em>

<em>Our new MP Ben Howlett makes much noise about how he is both 'proud of the NHS' and 
happy to rebel against his party in issues where there is clear evidence and public support.
Since the huge majority of the public don't want to see the NHS privatised, will we be able to
count on his support for today's bill, or will he all too predictably ignore the public will and
fall into line with his party now that he is elected?</em>
