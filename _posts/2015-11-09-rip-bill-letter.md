The following letter was sent to the Bath Chronicle:

Although they claim to favour 'small government', the Conservative appetite for
authoritarianism has been illustrated yet again by the upcoming Regulation of Investigatory
Powers Bill, allowing the government to spy on all of our most personal computer and phone
use. This measure, ineffective at actually stopping any serious crime, has been widely
slammed in regard to loss of our privacy. We would have the most intrusive state in Europe.

But Bath MP Ben Howlett must consider other consequences. He claims to support the cluster
of technology companies vital to Bath and Bristol, but as someone who has worked in such
companies for the last 15 years I can assure him that if his government's plans to end
secure Internet communication happen, a huge number of these companies will leave the UK.

It is tempting for governments to be seen to be 'doing something'. I suggest that Mr Howlett
considers just how bad such draconian laws are, not just for the privacy of the people of
Bath, but for the economy too.
