Voter apathy in the young is a real problem in the UK, so it was great to attend so many
school hustings in Bath in the General Election campaign, and for so many great questions
to be asked in those hustings.

The hustings at Hayesfield School was very well run and attended, and it was a pleasure
to be asked back today to face questions from the A-level politics students.

Again the questions were really good, covering the broken voting system used for
Westminster, the EU, immigration, local issues over a new Park and Ride scheme, 
and the airstrikes in Syria.

It was great to meet the students in a more informal setting than the hustings. Thanks
to them and their teacher, Catherine Merriman, for organising the session.
