2015 has been quite the year. These are dark times in many ways, and we are seeing the rights
and protections that have been hard-won over generations being torn away by the forces of
arrogance, ignorance and greed. Who would have thought, at the turn of the millenium,
that Britain would see a million people depending on food banks to survive, and the
architects of that destitution voted in again with a majority?

The government will continue its reckless destruction of our social safety net in 2016,
and it also plans a
<a href="http://weownit.org.uk/take-action/dont-sell-our-top-trumps">fire-sale of a huge
number of our assets</a>, more than any government in history. Selling-off profit-making
assets at a loss is, of course, yet more of the economic ineptitude that this government
is renowned for, and yet a friendly media somehow spins the opposition as less credible.
By the time the Tories are finished we will be forced to pay profit-making monopolies
to do anything - buy a house, mint coins, take out student loans - and you can bet that
a significant number of these companies won't be paying taxes in the UK either.

Also, as I write this, huge swathes of the country
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35190896">are under water</a> as we face yet
more extreme weather, entirely as predicted for decades as the consequence of our emissions
on the environment. This year has been the warmest on record
<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/12/26/3735055/christmas-heat-records-shattered/">
by quite some way</a>, and 13 of the 14 hottest years on record have taken place this
century. Yet the voice of the science deniers still grows louder in the press, causing far
too many people to doubt the need for action even
as their homes are flooded. It is beyond belief that in 2015, with the effect of climate
change ruining thousands of lives in the UK, our government is actually making things
worse with its failure to tackle flood prevention and stop destructive farming practices,
halting of renewable energy and pushing for even greater fossil fuel use, including fracking
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/16/fracking-under-national-parks-approved-by-mps-amid-acrimony">
under our national parks and other important areas</a>.

Meanwhile, the main opposition party is in disarray, busier destroying itself than standing-up
for our interests. Who knows what will happen to Labour, but fundamentally it's a 
party of neoliberal free-marketers who have found themselves with a leader who is
close to actually being socialist. Corbyn is a decent man, but he is in the wrong party,
and sympathetic members who think that his selection as leader will change it are at
best optimistic.

It would be so easy to get depressed about all of this and give up. That is what the
Tories, Murdoch and the usual suspects are counting on. In 2016 they will hope that the
EU referendum will keep us occupied while they dismantle the rest of the state. The
reality is that the referendum is an irrelevance compared to what our own government
is actually doing, but like Labour's leadership battles it is a gift to them as they
continue their work and <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2015/12/conservatives-are-rewriting-constitution-create-one-party-state">
quietly rig democracy so that they can never lose again</a>.

But we can choose not to play their game. Let's make 2016 the year we fight them. And
win. Because hear this - we <em>can</em> win. We can refuse to let them continue to
transfer the wealth of the country to the rich and powerful. We can refuse to let them
run our NHS into the ground. We can refuse to let them take away our rights at work, in
public places, in the law.

We can stand up to them, because together we have the
only thing they really fear, the only thing they can't control - numbers. We are the
many and they are the few, and ultimately this counts for more than you can imagine.
Because what the 1% have in power depends on the 99% listening to them and believing
them. We will never have the resources they have: the money, the media barons, the
power. But those resources mean nothing if people choose not to believe them, not
to listen to them, and not to bow down to injustice.

That is the resolution I ask you to join me in making. Help us to make 2016 the year
that we open the eyes of the people to what is happening. Help others to see what is
being taken away from us all and the lies we are being told to keep us compliant.
Help us to take this country back from the money men to whom people are purely a
vehicle for personal gain.

There is hope. Where this message gets a fair hearing we can win. In Bath this General
Election we got the largest increase in vote share despite having a tiny fraction of the resources
of the other parties. In every hustings where a poll was taken we came first. When people
hear the message of hope and fairness they
respond. We will never have as much money as those that place it above all else, so
the way we kick them out is on the streets, through word of mouth, through people power.

So please, make it your resolution to help spread the word, in whatever way you can.
It's no exaggeration to say that the country, and the world, depends on it. 
<a href="http://join.greenparty.org.uk/">Join our party</a> - you're all welcome,
and we're the only party where everyone has an equal say - ordinary people like us
who don't act for power, but to help our families, our neighbours, strangers, and the
world. Not through selfishness, but for the Common Good.

I wish you, your friends and family all the best for the New Year.
