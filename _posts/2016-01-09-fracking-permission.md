The Tories know that fracking is deeply unpopular but this displeases their friends and
funders in the fossil fuel industry. As a consequence they are removing your rights to
have any say over what happens near your home.

Their latest act is to remove the obligation for fracking firms to obtain planning
permission for exploratory explosives and drilling, thus removing a vital way that both
you and your local authority have any say.

Again, with this Tory government we see evidence that the voices of the wealthy are the
only important ones to them.
