Today was the second reading of the <a href="http://www.nhsbill2015.org">NHS Reinstatement
Bill</a> in the Commons. This cross-party bill basically restores the NHS by reversing
the ongoing privatisation, and undoing the disasterous changes made by the Tory and Lib Dem Health
Social Care Act, such as removing the responsibility of the
Health Secretary for even providing healthcare at all.

All in all, the Bill contained measures that healthcare professionals and analysts have
been calling for for years and has the backing of a large number of campaigners and
politicians.

Fast forward to today and the second reading. It was 'talked out' by a small number
of Tory MPs. This is a well-known method that is used, especially on Fridays when a lot of
MPs don't bother turning up, 
to stop legislation even going to a vote. It's massively undemocratic
but sadly something that happens. Thankfully it can be stopped if 100 MPs make something called
a 'closure motion'.

However, without worrying about the archaic nature of Parliament, the thing to take from
this is that is was obvious that at least 100 non-Tory MPs had to be there today. Senior
Labour figures such as Jeremy Corbyn had previously stated support for the bill, so you
would have thought that this wouldn't be a problem, right?

Only 18 Labour MPs turned up. <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nhs-reinstatement-bill-tory-mps-filibuster-debate-by-talking-about-deporting-foreigners-for-hours-a6925781.html">
The bill was, predictably, talked-out</a>.

Now we can blame the Tories for their undemocratic use of parliamentary time here, of
course, but the fact that they would do this was completely predictable. Who we can
be angry with, completely justifiably, is Labour. If Labour had ensured that enough
MPs were present they could have stopped the filibustering and taken the bill to a vote.
As it was, not even Corbyn turned up.

Would the vote have been won? That's not essential. If a proper debate was held
then Tory MPs would have been forced to publicly state how they wanted NHS services
privatised - something they desperately still denied against all evidence at the last
election. It would have shown them for what they are. Equally, Labour MPs who may well
be in government in 2020 would be on record stating a willingness to end privatisation.
Would that have held them to it? No, but it would make it more likely.

As it is, none of this happened. Labour MPs didn't feel it was worth their time to
try to save the NHS.

Labour has picked-up members and the support of progressives with the promise that they
have changed - that they will now oppose austerity and support public services remaining
public. They had the best opportunity yet to prove that today and almost completely
failed to do so.

What is the lesson we should take from this? If you want politicians who will actually
stand-up for the NHS, you need real progressives like Greens, Plaid and the SNP. Labour
is not fit for purpose.
