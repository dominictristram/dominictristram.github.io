On the 11th of November Virgin Care was finally confirmed as the successful bidder to run
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/11/virgin-care-700m-contract-200-nhs-social-care-services-bath-somerset ">
over 200 community healthcare services in Bath and NE Somerset</a>. This was decided by
unanimous vote by the local Clinical Commissioning Group and a majority vote (35 to 22) by
the Conservative-led local authority.

As a Green Party member I am opposed to privatisation of our NHS and running NHS or other
publicly-funded health services for profit. Indeed, this is very much the view of the
population of Bath, which is why I was elected as a local hospital governor in 2012 on a
platform of opposing such changes. However, regardless of whether one agrees with the
private sector running our health services or not, this whole deal has been a farce.

There has been an apparent neutering of democracy in several stages of the bidding process.
One of our Green Party councillors in Bath, Lin Patterson, sits on the council’s Health
and Wellbeing Select Committee. She was <a href="http://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/bath-councillor-removed-from-discussions-about-virgin-care-s-contract-bid-feels-she-was-spied-on/story-29774093-detail/story.html
">asked to remove herself from discussions about the
Virgin Care bid</a> as a result of signing a petition against the services going to a private
provider, and the council being concerned that this might be a basis for Virgin to sue.

Of course, there is no legal basis at all for Virgin to do so, so either the Conservatives
running the council considered it as a convenient way to remove a dissenting voice, or
they genuinely do fear Virgin Care, in which case they should possibly not be handing them
vital healthcare services. In either case, constituents who voted for our councillor at
least partly on the basis of her views on private health providers had their voices ignored.

Democracy was also badly served in the closing stages of the bidding process. Members of
the public were not allowed to ask questions at the meeting of the CCG where it was
decided to give Virgin the contract. Later at the council meeting, two motions requesting
for the decision to be delayed until details of the bid could be scrutinised by the
council’s Select Committee were rejected with no decent explanation.

While Virgin Care have won many services around the country, the deal in Bath would be the
first time any adult social care services have been run for profit. Not to allow the
Select Committee to examine the detail of the proposed deal seems foolhardy, at best. The
<a href="http://www.yourcareyourway.org/sites/default/files/20161111%20YCYW%20FBC%20FINAL.pdf">
76 page business case recommending Virgin Care to the public</a> was published less than
a week before the decision was made - hardly a lot of time for careful examination.

The council and CCG put much weight on the fact that Virgin Care promised to ‘reinvest any
profit’ back into local services. One must question how anyone who believes that this
promise means anything is in a position to decide how to spend £700m of our money. Virgin
Care, like many if not all companies that win NHS work, doesn’t make profits.

In 2015 Virgin Care made a loss of £9.1m, much as it has for each of the last five years.
There are many instances of multinational companies using elaborate structures of holding
companies and loans to ensure that no taxes are paid on profits. Indeed, the ultimate
owner of Virgin Care is based in a tax haven.

Profits are being made, and to assume that they aren’t and that Virgin Care wish to lose
money for seven years as some sort of public service shows those awarding this work to
them are either dangerously naive or manifestly underestimating the intelligence of the
public. Or, more likely, they simply don’t care that the promises are worthless.

The largest opposition group on BaNES council is the Liberal Democrats. Recently they
have been vocal in opposing the Virgin Care bid, but this position must presumably be on a
technicality in the bidding process rather than an objection in principle. After all, the
Liberal Democrats voted for the Health and Social Care Act while part of the coalition
government, despite it being in no manifesto and against the wishes of both the public and
the medical profession. Many of us warned at the time that it would lead to the fragmentation and
forced privatisation of the NHS, and for them to object to this now doesn’t seem very
convincing.

One must take both a long term forward view and a consideration of the past to separate
convenient political opposition from genuine concern over the future of our NHS. When I
ran for Parliament in Bath last year I was the only candidate warning of the dangers of allowing
profit-making companies access to vital services. The profit motive leads to procurement
processes like this where those assessing bids seem blinded by slick marketing and
meaningless promises. Once these services are in the hands of people who profit from them
it will be very difficult to get them back. It is
immensely frustrating when the very events some of us predicted back in 2010, when we were
dismissed as alarmist, are now coming to pass.
