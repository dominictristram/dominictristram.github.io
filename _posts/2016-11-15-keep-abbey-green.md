There is an important by-election coming up in Bath on Thursday.

As we face more Tory ideological cuts to services, unwanted and counterproductive new car parks on valuable meadows, and inaction on housing and air pollution, it's vital we keep our voice in the council and have our say in decisions.

Only the Greens can beat the Tories in Abbey Ward. Only the Greens will take real action in Bath and fight for normal residents and small businesses.

Please vote for our candidate, Vipul Patel. Even better, help the campaign, put up a poster and let your friends know how important it is to get another Green councillor.
