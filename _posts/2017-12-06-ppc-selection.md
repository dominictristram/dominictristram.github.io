# Local campaigner to stand in snap election in Bath

A long-standing local environmental and social justice campaigner was today chosen as the Green Party candidate for Bath
in any snap General Election.

Dom Tristram, who stood in Bath in 2015, has been selected again by the party in Bath. In 2015 he gained the largest
increase in vote share of any party and won every exit poll of voters over dozens of hustings and public meetings
through the campaign.

He said: “It is an honour to be chosen again to be the Green Party’s candidate for any snap general election. The world
of politics is in disarray and the environment, indeed the very air we breathe, seems to have been forgotten along the
way. Bath desperately needs a voice to speak up for it at the same time as maintaining a principled stand on the other
serious issues facing our city and country.”

“I am passionate about our beautiful, diverse and vibrant city, where I have lived all of my working life. I believe
the city is best served by politicians who have made their lives here and intend to stay here. I know what our area
needs because my family and I rely on the same public services as everyone else.” 

“We are being governed by a failing coalition of a weak Conservative Party dictated to by a fringe party with extremist
views. We have seen an amateurish and failing Brexit strategy that threatens to destroy not only our economy but also
our environment and workplace rights. It can’t continue and I believe a snap general election is now inevitable.”

“The Conservatives have proved that they cannot escape the destructive influence of their hard-right Eurosceptic fringe.
The Liberal Democrats still cling to a fixation with privatisation despite the carnage that their NHS reforms resulted
in. Labour have moved closer to us on social justice but have no coherent message on the environment, Brexit or our
unsustainable economic model.”

“The choice in that election is clear. Only the Green Party offer real solutions to protect our world for generations
to come while actually tackling the underlying causes of inequality and failing services, rather than patching-up
the symptoms.”

The Green Party is fully democratic and does not enforce shortlists for selections. Dom was selected via a poll of
all local party members using a Single Transferrable Vote.
