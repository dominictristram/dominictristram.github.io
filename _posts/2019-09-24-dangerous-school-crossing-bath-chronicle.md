I have been <a href="https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/news/somerset-news/horrified-parent-says-bad-parking-3354037">
featured in an article in the local newspaper</a>, the Bath Chronicle, where I complain about
the zebra crossing I have to use four times a day. I wanted to highlight how dangerous it is for people
to park illegally close to these crossings.
