As you might have noticed, I have updated this Web site. There was a bunch of stuff that I wanted to do:

 - make everything faster and less fussy
 - move to a newer static site template (I use Jekyll, now  with the <a href="https://beautifuljekyll.com">Beautiful Jekyll theme</a>) that is maintained
 - update a bunch of info
 - include stuff about my music and tech activities

Hopefully everything is easier to find now. Let me know if it's more confusing!
