As the Tories announce a ban on new solar farms on agricultural land, we need to wonder
why.

Transcript:

Well here we are in a lovely sunny day in October and the sun has
rather reminded me of a story I heard today or yesterday that the
government is seeking to ban solar farms on farmland or installing
solar panels on farmland, with the excuse being that we should be
prioritizing food production now.

There's a couple of things about this. One is that at the same time they're pushing to
reopen and licence more North sea oil and gas exploration. Stopping solar
and trying to encourage gas in a time of climate emergency is pretty stupid. But that aside,
you have to remember  why solar farms are appearing on farmland. There's two things. One, you can
actually farm underneath them. If you have certain crops or maybe
poultry and other livestock, you can put them under soda panels. That's
fine. You can have dual use in a lot of these fields, so it's absolutely
efficient as a way of using the space.

That's the first thing. So it's not wasting space that for agriculture,
it's getting extra use out of space that would've had less use, and that's an important
point. Another thing is why farmers are leasing their land, or sometimes doing this
themselves, for solar?

Well, it's because they can't make the money on the agriculture because
food is undervalued. Even though food prices are going up, they still
don't get paid enough to cover the cost of production, or the
land is generally not suitable for the sort of agriculture that would
make the money. So why not, they think, make some money from renewables
and let's face it, the country could do with the energy.

So why is the government saying that
they can't do that?  Well, from broad perspective, placing solar panels
on agricultural land doesn't make sense. We should be putting them on
land that's otherwise used for buildings, for example, on roofs.

That would be the most sensible place to put them. But the government's
not doing that, is it? It's not mandating solar panels on roofs for new
buildings or existing buildings. It's largely ignoring the fact
that we've got all this space we could be generating energy from, and
it's up to private individuals whether they do or not, and of course of
there is a cost to that.

But the government is not encouraging anyone to do it. In fact,
it's discouraging people from doing it by scrapping FIT payments. So
farmers are choosing to do this because they're not getting the money from the
agriculture that they could be running on that land. The main reason
they're not getting the money is because of Brexit.

It's now much
harder for people to make money to cover the cost of production from farming
because of the friction that has been introduced into selling our goods
to our main customer, which is obviously also our closest customer, the EU - both Ireland
and the rest of Europe. That's now much
harder, much more costly for farmers to do. What were already pretty tight margins are
much tighter, so a lot of farmers have either decided to stop producing certain products,
or in fact not be farmers at all any more, and others are
diversifying. Now, whether that's camp sites or solar farms or anything
else like that, these are all way farmers can make money from their land
when the land is not paying for itself with agriculture.

Now we've seen also
at the same time, if you remember, the government rolled back on their
commitment to pay farmers for stewardship when Brexit happened. There
was talk of ending subsidies for just growing loads of food we don't
need and pay farmers for looking after land. While you may not have noticed, that's all
been rolled back, There was
some optimistic talk about it, and lots of farmers even applied for some
of these grants, but they've all been shelled for the indefinite future.
So what are farmers going to do? You tell them they can't set up solar
farms, they're going to have to do something else.

What? What could that something else be? I can tell you what it wouldn't
be - it wouldn't be as useful for getting us out of the energy crisis
because ultimately we need more renewable generation in this country.
And if farmers are the people willing to allow their land to do it, and
the consumers with roofs and the money to buy panels aren't doing it, 
let the farmers do it and get us out of a hole. By stopping them you're just going to
increase reliance on gas and increase energy prices, which isn't going to help anyone.
