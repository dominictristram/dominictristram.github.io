Nicola Sturgeon is in trouble for saying she despises what Tories stand for. But that
viewpoint is entirely valid.

Generated transcript:

Now you've probably seen recently that Nicola Sturgeon has caused a bit
of a fuss in some circles by saying that she detests the Tories. 
She later clarified that she detests the party and everything they
stand for rather than individual Tories, which is clearly
what she meant in the first place.

This has
upset quite a few people. The ask how one could you say such a thing? It's
unprofessional. You should never let people's politics get in the way of
how you feel about them. The language is uncalled for and all that sort
of stuff. But it's not exactly a controversial viewpoint when I say
good on her, because actually if somebody holds those views and makes it their business
to enforce those views on the people, it's justified. For example the Conservatives
today have blocked some of the very
few good things that Michael Gove pushed for when he was in a position
of power in their party. So they're getting rid of the ban on no fault evictions
and lots of protections that were going to be
bought in for renters.

Now, it's pretty rare that the Tories do something for people who don't have as much and
have fewer advantages in
life. So for the Tories to then shelve those few things (which were
manifesto commitments, let's remember) is appalling. So there's a PM with no
mandate doing things with no mandate and getting rid of the things they
actually were voted in to do by some people, eg actually had a mandate for.

I mean, that's pretty detestable, isn't it? It makes a mockery of
democracy for one thing. But there's no reason to stop a
ban on no fault evictions other than potentially pressure from landlords
and people with money.

It's taking something that some of the cherished 'red wall' voters that they have who got
them into power. That's the sort
of policy that would appeal to them. And so some of them voted Conservative
and now we see that all of the things that could
have conceivably helped people with less money have all been stripped
out.

And now it's all become about helping people with money. Even long term
voters are beginning to realize that this is a party that's been taken
over by the hard right.  There's no 'One Nation Conservatives' left in a
position of responsibility in the party.

The Tory party of old that could have commanded respect (in some ways) from me and
people like me is gone. It's all about enriching the already rich, and
it is despicable. It's a body where if people actively support it at this point
they're worthy of contempt and they're worthy of criticism because they are
basically trying to make other people's lives worse, and it's all just
for them. If it doesn't make a profit then these people don't count, and that's
not a viewpoint that is worthy of respect.
