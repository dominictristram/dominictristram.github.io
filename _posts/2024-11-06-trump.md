I set out today to discuss the Conservative Party leadership election here in the UK and
the implications of our new Tory leader. However, as events have unfolded across the
Atlantic, my initial plan feels a bit trivial in light of the bigger picture. Like many,
I presumed—perhaps naively—that the American election would head in a different direction.
Yet, here we are: Donald Trump has won.

While the outcome of the Conservative leadership contest certainly holds significance
within British politics, it pales in comparison to the potential ramifications of Trump’s
return to power. The issues we face with certain Tory figures, however controversial or
disagreeable they may be, cannot compare to the scale of dismay surrounding Trump. Unlike
Conservative leaders, Trump openly denies climate change, has a history of convictions and
accusations of sexual assault, and is embroiled in controversies ranging from mishandling 
state secrets to even more shocking accusations. Despite any criticism one might level at
Kamala Harris or the American Democrats, the contrast in leadership styles and values
between the two parties is stark.

Certainly, I have my qualms with the American Democrats. They aren’t truly left-leaning,
and their pro-Israel stance, particularly regarding the ongoing Gaza conflict, is far
from something I align with. Nonetheless, whoever they put forward—whether it’s Biden, who
many argue is too old, or Harris, with her policy positions that I can’t support—is
fundamentally better for democracy than someone with Trump’s record. Here is a man who
openly admits to behaviour many would find repulsive, has mused about using military force
against his political opponents, and has even chosen a running mate who has questioned
the voting rights of childless women. It’s a surreal scenario, almost like something out
of a dark political satire.

When Trump lost the last election, he didn’t just concede quietly; he attempted a coup.
The images of him hoarding classified documents in his bathroom, allegedly sharing secrets
with foreign powers, paint an astonishingly grim picture. Meanwhile, figures like Elon
Musk and other so-called ‘crypto bros’ are aligning themselves with Trump, seeing in him
an easily manipulable figure who could serve their interests. It brings to mind the
oligarchs in 1990s Russia, only this time it’s in America, with the ultra-wealthy vying
to consolidate power.

Some might try to dismiss this outcome with the assurance that it’s only four years, and
people will see reason in time. Yet, America’s political landscape doesn’t work that way.
The politically appointed Supreme Court is already stacked in the Republicans’ favour, and
within the next four years, Trump could appoint additional justices. This would likely
solidify a hard-right majority, capable of dismantling rights and protections long held
dear by many Americans. Even if something were to happen to Trump, his influence would
remain entrenched in the judiciary and the Senate for years, shaping policy far beyond
his own tenure.

What’s particularly staggering is that this time, Trump might even have won the popular
vote, a feat he didn’t achieve in his first election. It’s baffling to think that so many
could support a figure who openly disregards democratic principles and exhibits disdain
for so many groups within his own voter base—women, non-white citizens, and immigrants,
to name a few. It’s enough to make Brexit seem like a minor hiccup in comparison.

While I still hold the belief that people are generally decent, albeit sometimes misled,
today has sorely tested that faith. Watching the outcome of this election unfold, I find
myself deeply concerned about what lies ahead. America’s leadership doesn’t only impact
its own citizens but has a ripple effect on global issues—especially the climate crisis
and conflicts in places like Ukraine.

In any case, here we are on November 6th, faced with an unpredictable and turbulent path
ahead. Perhaps, when the dust settles, I’ll muster the energy to revisit the topic of the
Tory leadership. But for now—well, let’s just brace ourselves.
