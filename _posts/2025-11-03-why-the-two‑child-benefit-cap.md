<p>Despite decades of the Right claiming that work is the route out of poverty, a significant
number of families on low incomes, even those with a parent in work, are trapped in a cycle
of hardship.</p>

<p>The cap on means‑tested support for a third or subsequent child (the two‑child cap) is
a vivid example of this. Introduced in 2017 by the Tories, it has been continued by Labour
in government.</p>

<p>The cap prevents households on certain benefits from claiming the full ‘child element’
of Universal Credit (or equivalent) for any child after the second one. Research has shown
that this is increasing child poverty: <a href="https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/no-half-measures/">the Resolution Foundation forecasts</a>
child poverty after housing costs rising from about 31 % in 2024‑25 to 34 % by 2029‑30 due
to the policy, and that by scrapping the cap 330,000 children could be lifted out of poverty.</p>

<p>A policy that reduced the ‘welfare bill’ by cutting support for children undermines the
principle of social security and helping those most in need. It adds to the inequality for
parents are in part time work or have ‘zero hour’ contracts, or those with caring
responsibilities.</p>

<p>Cutting support for children in poorer families also has an impact on those children
for their whole lives as it can reduce social mobility - poorer childhoods often translate
into worse health, education and employment outcomes.</p>

<p>In the Green Party <a href="https://greenparty.org.uk/2024/06/17/scrap-to-the-two-child-benefit-cap-urge-greens/">we want to remove this punitive cap</a>
and ensure benefit systems treat all children with dignity: guarantee a living wage for
parents (and everyone else) and support vital public services, often most used by those
raising children on lower incomes. Welfare should be stabilising, not restrictive. Coupled
with investment in affordable housing, insulation and social infrastructure these policies
create an environment where families, on all incomes, can thrive.</p>

<p>By contrast, the approach from the Right and, unfortunately, Labour, tends to emphasise
employment and the ‘free market’ while keeping welfare safety nets tightly restrictive and
hard to claim. The two‑child cap is a clear example of this: it expects work or market
income to compensate for the benefit loss, but fails to account for other cost pressures
or insecure employment. As a result it has disproportionately impacted larger families on
low incomes (many of whom are working) and increased poverty.</p>

<p>This is a fundamental problem when any policy, and any government, prioritises reducing
spending over reversing inequality. Greens reject this. Governments should exist for the
wellbeing of the people and the protection of the poorest and most vulnerable.</p>
