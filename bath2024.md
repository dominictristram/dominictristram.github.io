I am the Green Party candidate for the constituency of Bath for the election due before the start of 2025.

I was selected for Bath in the 2019 election but stood aside as part of a national electoral agreement with other parties.

I was the Green candidate for Bath in 2015 where I, with the help of the local party, acheived around 12% of the vote. This was one of the best Green Party results in the country and led to us being a target seat in 2017.

My success in 2015 was because I fought to win. I am doing the same this time. It's already clear (from the 2023 local elections) that the Green Party is ahead of Labour in Bath, and I believe we are ahead of the Tories too. Let's prove it.
