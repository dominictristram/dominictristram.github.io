<p align="center"><font size="7">Aber Gallery</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">I make no apologies for the bad quality of some
of these photos- I appear in plenty of bad photos on the web myself and the last
dregs of sympathy have been drained away...</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">I also have no idea in what order some of these
events occurred, so I've made a good old guess. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">They start off in the summer of 2000, with Hels
and Nanooe <a href="ballet.html">doing ballet</a> on the seafront at about 3 in
the morning (a good place to start, I felt). There was also <a href="hennight.html">Mary's
hen night</a>, which ended up in the Bay.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">After that there is a big jump to the winter of
2000/2001 when I was living in Waunfawr, and at New Year there was snow... with <a href="shaddy.html">Shaddy</a>
being <a href="shaddysnow.html">childish</a>!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">A bit later in the year, and it was warm enough
for a barbeque at <a href="jimbbq.html">Jim's</a>, with <a href="hayzbbq.html">Hazel</a>
and others. Jim is getting the hose to spray the flying ants, in case you were
wondering.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Most of the photos I have are from <a href="claire.html">Claire's</a>
leaving do in the late summer, at Agra. We started off in Scholars where I got a
picture of <a href="edhels.html">Ed and Hels</a>. In Agra we took over most of the
restaurant! <a href="arjan.html">Arjan</a>, <a href="hilary.html">Hilary</a>,
<a href="jeansharon.html">Jean
and Sharon</a>, <a href="jimrich.html">Jim and Rich</a>, <a href="johnalison.html">John
and Alison</a>, <a href="nickyhywel.html">Nicky and Hywel</a> and <a href="paul.html">Paul</a>
amongst others. <a href="anjamints.html">Anja</a> and designs on the after dinner
mints...</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">The rest of the pictures are from my house in
Llanilar. One of <a href="rach.html">Rach</a> before she left at the end of
September 2001. Then <a href="shan.html">Shan</a> and <a href="mike.html">Mike</a> moved
in... Christmas time visits: <a href="faye.html">Faye</a>, <a href="nick.html">Nick</a>,
<a href="gregshan.html">Greg and Shan</a>.</font></p>
