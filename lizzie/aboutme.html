<p align="center"><font face="Impact" size="7">About Me :-P</font></p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="fig.jpg" align="left" width="184" height="248">
<font size="4">Well this is me- about 17 years ago. If you want to know the
nitty gritty of my achievements then you can look at my <a href="cv2.html"> curriculum
vitae</a>-
especially if you think you might like to offer me a £40k job.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">To find out about who I don't&nbsp; like I have a
growing list of '<a href="antigods.html">anti-Gods</a>'
and another of '<a href="heros.html">heros and
heroines</a>'.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">I was born in Durham in 1978, but we moved down
to Bristol not long after, so I have no memory of living there. This does
however mean that I can of course claim to be from either North or South
depending on which is least likely to get me beaten up at any one time!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">My interest in wildlife and birdwatching caused
me to study biology- first a degree and now a PhD, both in <a href="http://www.aberystwyth.com/">Aberystwyth</a>. When I
was about seven I was first taken over to Skomer and I guess that is what really
sold conservation to me. From the age of 14 I worked voluntarily for the <a href="http://www.wildlifetrust.org.uk/avon/"> Avon
Wildlife Trust</a> and at 16 I did a course allowing me to co-lead workdays. I gave
up my work for the Trust while I did my A-levels to do <a href="http://www.bto.org/"> bird ringing</a> instead. I
was all for a career in conservation and management until I decided that was far
too much like hard work- lots of competition and no money. So I took up science.
For more work and less money. I'll get it sorted one day.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">When I'm not working- which seems to be rarer and
rarer as time goes on- I like <a href="gallery.html">drawing</a>,
in fact I used to want to do that for a career until Art at school changed my
mind! I play the piano rather badly and I probably watch too much TV. I still
like disappearing off into the middle of Wales with my binoculars though.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4"> If you want to know
more about what I am doing now look at my <a href="mywork.html"> work page</a> but don't expect to find it
interesting unless you have a passion for fungi!</font></p>
