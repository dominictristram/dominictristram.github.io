<p align="left"><font size="4">Here are some photos of my family. I've been far
too slow getting these up. And I'll tell you what, one day I'll sit down with
more time and get this scanning images thing sussed. I've had to do these in a
hurry and these really need re-scanning as they are a bit pixilated but I guess
that will have to do for now.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">There are pictures from our visit this Easter
(2002) to Pembrokeshire... <a href="michael.html">Michael</a> outside the
Lobster Pot in Marloes,&nbsp; <a href="dporthgain.html">my Dad</a> near the
Sloop Inn in Porthgain, and <a href="allporthgain.html">all three</a> on the
coast path... although I can't quite remember where I took this.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">The rest of the photos I have are from our trip
to Skomer in May 2002. The weather was not too great but all the bluebells were
out. I managed to get a few photos while the sun was out! <a href="ftbluebells.html">My
mum</a> in the bluebells, and <a href="dgarland.html">my Dad</a> sitting on
the rocks by the Garland Stone. After I took these it kinda rained non-stop till
the last evening before we got rushed off early in the morning due to dire
weather warnings- the island boat had already been carried away by the storms!
Anyhow these evening shots are&nbsp; <a href="dsilhouette.html">my
Dad</a>, and... I didn't get away with it... my mum got one of <a href="fnight.html">me</a>
too!&nbsp;</font></p>
