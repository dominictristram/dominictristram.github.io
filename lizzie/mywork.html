<p align="center"><font size="7" face="Impact">My
Work</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">I work in the Institute of
Biological Sciences, University of Wales, Aberystwyth, with Dr. Gareth Griffith,
in the field of mycology- that's fungus, for any non-biologists mad enough to be
reading this!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The official title of my PhD
is, 'The effects of disturbance on the <img border="0" src="botlogonew1.gif" align="left" width="208" height="218">biodiversity
and population structure of rhizosphere fungi in grasslands'. Things have
changed a little since then- I am working on root-colonising fungi rather than
rhizosphere fungi- but fundamentally the project is the same.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The project aims to test the
hypothesis that agricultural disturbance such as ploughing and fertilisation
have a detrimental effect on these fungi, analogous to that observed on
botanical biodiversity. Half my funding is provided by the <a href="http://www.gardenofwales.org.uk/"> National Botanic
Garden of Wales</a>, my field site in Carmarthenshire, Wales, and the other half by
the university.</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The hypothesis is tested,
essentially, by comparing the communities of root colonising fungi <img border="0" src="fusarium.gif" align="left" width="221" height="226">isolated
from internal root tissue from disturbed and undisturbed grassland sites. The
form-genus <i>Fusarium</i> is also studied in more depth to examine differences
in genetic diversity of isolates from the two sites. <i>Fusarium</i> was chosen
as it is commonly occurring and experimentally tractable. I am also
investigating novel and rapid methods for the reliable identification of this
taxonomically complex group, such as <a href="http://gepasi.dbs.aber.ac.uk/roy/ftir/ftirhome.htm"> Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy</a> and
Directed Termination Polymerase Chain Reaction, backed up by sequence data
obtained from field isolates.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Details for my research
group can be found on the <a href="http://users.aber.ac.uk/gwg"> Mycology Group</a> page.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Also available is my <a href="poster.html">
research poster</a>. It isn't all completely legible due to the size problem but
I'm always happy to answer questions on <a href="mailto:holcus@hotmail.com">holcus@hotmail.com</a></font></p>
