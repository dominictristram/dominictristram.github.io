<P> There seem to be a lot of photos from gull ringing season this year. In fact the gulls feature almost more in these photos than do the people... anyway, ta to Jane as some of these photos are actually hers. Also, not all the pictures are stunning quality but I am having to be a bit economical with my memory on the network. Anyway, enjoy! </P>
