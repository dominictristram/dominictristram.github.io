</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>I'm a puffin with a purpose</P>
<P>Flying out to sea</P>
<P>To get a load of little fish</P>
<P>To feed the family.</P>
<P>I'm a puffin with a beer-gut</P>
<P>Outside the <I>Blue Eight Arms, </I><SUP>1</SUP><I> </P>
</I><P>Who's gone to meet his puffin mates</P>
<P>And show the chicks my charms.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>CHORUS</P>
<I><P>We're puff, puff, puffins</P>
<P>Standing in a row</P>
<P>We're puff, puff, puffins</P>
<P>Guarding our burr-ows</P>
<P>We've all of us a purpose</P>
<P>Though we ain't all quite sure what...</P>
<P>So we're puff, puff, puffins</P>
<P>Standing in a row</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</I><P>I'm a puffin with a purpose</P>
<P>Looking down a hole</P>
<P>I've a feeling that I live here</P>
<P>But, so's this Skomer vole.</P>
<P>So I'll scratch my head and wag my tail</P>
<P>And shake my silly beak</P>
<P>I'll go away and think a while</P>
<P>And let you know next week.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>CHORUS</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I'm a puffin with a porpoise</P>
<P>Chasing off a gull.</P>
<P>I think I got a bit confused,</P>
<P>Is this the Isle of Mull?</P>
<P>I'm a puffin with no purpose</P>
<P>Living on the dole</P>
<P>I have to fly to Milford now </P>
<P>To sign on my parole.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>CHORUS</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I'm a puffin with a purpose</P>
<P>To feed my chicks unseen.</P>
<P>They're watching from the warden's house</P>
<P>But I've a clever scheme:</P>
<P>I'll shut my eyes, fly in reverse,</P>
<P>And leave the fish at sea</P>
<P>They'll never guess what I have done</P>
<P>Oh WHOOPEE! Clever me!</P>

<P>One got stuck in a lobster pot</P>

<P>Cleaning the toilet floor</P>
<P>One swooned over the Elsan</P>

<P>4 little volunteers</P>
<P>Gazing out to sea</P>
<P>One got **** on by a gull</P>
<P>Then there were 3</P>

<P>3 little volunteers</P>
<P>Boiling up a stew</P>
<P>One had to clear the mess</P>
<P>Then there were 2</P>

<P>2 little volunteers</P>
<P>Basking in the sun</P>
<P>One got baked like a lobster</P>
<P>Then there was 1</P>
<P>Who sadly could not cope alone</P>
<P>And retired, stressed, to bed</P>
<P>So now they have employed the voles</P>
<P>To do the work instead!</P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>Gentle valley to rocky ledge,</P>
<P>Loosestrife to ragwort, bracken and sedge,</P>
<P>Seaweeds and lichens along the shoreline;</P>
<P>Oh how I wished that this island was mine-</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>And yet I know this cannot be;</P>
<P>This island could never belong to me</P>
<P>For though my heart is steadfast here,</P>
<P>Etched into every cliff face sheer,</P>
<P>I would not always be able to stay</P>
<P>However much I wished that I may,</P>
<P>Nor does the island need me to;</P>
<P>Its beauty is great, but its needs are few.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>For the island, like a bird, is free</P>
<P>And though it may not belong to me</P>
<P>I see myself in every stone</P>
<P>And know that I am not alone-</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>For many people have pledged their life</P>
<P>And soul to this place, in whole or in part,</P>
<P>And so we make the island's foundation</P>
<P>Within ourselves, with faith in creation</P>
<P>Of this love- that should we be gone long</P>
<P>Our hearts would be echoed in the islands song</P>
<P>For those who love will understand</P>
<P>This our voice of the sea, the birds and the land</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So wherever you are, this isle can be yours</P>
<P>If you wish it to be, and so simply pause</P>
<P>To remember this love, for where your heart stays</P>
<P>This is your home- and will be always.</P>

<P>Without attending to your seat</P>
<P>We came to love your little ways:</P>
<P>Your handle that kept dropping off</P>
<P>Kept us amused for many days.</P>
<P>There's nothing like your special smell</P>
<P>We really liked your lid as well.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We would wait for fall of night</P>
<P>To make more beautiful the sight</P>
<P>Of daily visits to the pit</P>
<P>To empty you of "it"</P>
<P>And nearly falling in was fun</P>
<P>And we were sad when all was done.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We hope you never get the push</P>
<P>For something so crude as a flush.</P>
