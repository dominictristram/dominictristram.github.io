I have written and played music for some time. I try to do something new with every song - it might not be the best way to get better at what I
already play, but it makes it fun to do!

I currently have two musical projects you can listen to:

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://goodnessguild.com/">The Goodness Guild</a> - a fusion of folk, rock and electronica with lyrics</li> 
  <li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1ZOACWYcOBquIuEIezMHP9?si=GM3hCHB3Qp-6QF2UR5VlCg">Radstock</a> - electronica, cyberpunk and ambient
  instrumentals</li>
</ul>

I hope you'll give them a listen! I'm writing and recording more as time allows - if you 'follow' my artists on Spotify etc you'll be notified of new stuff.
