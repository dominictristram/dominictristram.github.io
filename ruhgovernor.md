In November 2012 I was elected as a Governor for the Royal United Hospital in Bath. My
constituency was City of Bath, with a population of 90,232 people. I jointly represented them
with another public governor, Amanda Buss. I worked as a governor until late 2016.

The role of governors is to provide the link between the Trust and the local community, to
ensure that the views of the local people are heard and fed back to the Board of Directors.

Governors do not undertake operational management of the Trust; rather they collectively
hold the Board of Directors to account for the Trust's performance and advise on its
future development.

I stood on a strong anti Health and Social Care Act platform. Readers of my blog will know
that I think this legislation is basically intended to destroy the NHS as we know it, and
I am entirely against the privatisation of the health service we all own.
