I have lived in Bath for 17 years, have been a dedicated party member for ten years and have held many officer roles at local and regional level.

I believe a credible Westminster candidate must have -

relevant experience and understanding as well as enthusiasm:
<ul>
	<li>I have worked for several NHS and government agencies, including the Environment, Highways and the Home Office and have detailed knowledge of public services</li>
	<li>was elected as a public governor at the RUH from 2012-2016</li>
	<li>have taken part in dozens of hustings, meetings and panels and debated with over ten current and former MPs and MEPs</li>
</ul>

a proven track record of results:
<ul>
 <li>When I stood for Bath in 2015 we won 12% of the vote, up from 2.4% in 2010, just 1% short of Labour. This was one of the best Green results and made us a target seat in 2017</li>
 <li>At hustings I won every exit poll</li>
 <li>Successful regional radio and TV appearances</li>
 <li>Regardless of ‘Green surges’ and party help I win debates</li>
</ul>

a high profile:
<ul>
	<li>I spoke at this year’s Glastonbury Festival</li>
	<li>appearing at rallies including against Virgin’s Bath NHS take-over with Ken Loach</li>
	<li>television and radio, including BBC1’s Sunday Politics</li>
	<li>a highly visible social media and local media presence</li>
</ul>

If selected I plan to get us building on 2015’s success. I will continue with my assertive position where we take the vital fight for environmental and social justice to the other parties on our own terms.
